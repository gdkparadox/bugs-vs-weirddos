# bugs-vs-weirddos

# about the project
An awesome retro game dedicated to the everyday struggles of any programmer: dealing with bugs. The concept was to create an endless game, easily adaptable to any theme and explandable with additional features. Our team has put their hearts and minds into writing a clean, easily maintainable code while also focusing on smooth UX, and we are proud of what we have achieved.

Bugs VS WeirDDOS requires speed and resilience as the difficulty gets harder with every new wave of bugs. Do you dare to test your skill?

# context
This game was created as a part of a 10-day coding challenge after only three weeks of studying Java.
